        <h2> G√©n√©rative art </h2>
        <p>
          G√©n√©rative Art is using programing and computation as a mean of artistic expression.  
          A first serie called <i> FluXP </i> generated with a python code that uses Fluid simulations and a buch of colors. This was an experimentation presses with daily publications on my instagram. 
          Each pieces is cherry-picked from a base of random variation and manual parameter tweaking.

        <h2> RandLA-Net - 3D segmentation </h2>
        <p>
          As a school project, in team with <a href=https://github.com/aRI0U>Alain Riou</a> we encoded a PyTorch version of the  <a href=https://github.com/QingyongHu/RandLA-Net>RandLA-Net paper</a>, originaly only available in Tensorflow. In the constrained time and ressources we had, we didn't managed to reproduce the results of the original paper. 
          Although, our architecture got used from multiple peoples as a working base; with about 50 forks and 250 start on the <a href=https://github.com/aRI0U/RandLA-Net-pytorch> github repository </a>
